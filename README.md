# WaveSandcastleCellularAutomata
A wave Sandcastle Cellular Automata for MCM/ICM 2020 B. We were delighted by team 2007698's paper and codes, which introduced their CA(Cellular Automata) model. We made a new CA rule and drew a different conclusion finally.

Run begin.m to go on experiments.

## Cellular Automata rule
